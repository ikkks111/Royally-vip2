You can play Indian rummy on two player tables or six player tables with either a single or two decks of cards. Just sit around the table and take turns picking and discarding cards. You can choose to pick cards from either a closed or open deck, but remember that discarded cards must be placed in the open deck. When playing rummy online, your objective is to arrange the 13 cards you’ve been dealt into sets and sequences. You must make at least two sets – one without a Joker (pure sequence) and the other can use the Joker. The game starts with a toss determining the player who will make the first move. Remember to focus on making a pure sequence first, then the second sequence, followed by other sequences or sets. Have fun playing and always remember to play responsibly!" }, { heading: "How to Deposit and Withdraw?", content: "Extensive Payment Options: We offer a variety of payment methods, such as debit/credit cards, net banking, and UPI payments, providing users with the flexibility to select their preferred payment option for convenience.
